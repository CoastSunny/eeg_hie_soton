# Pipeline for the Classification of HIE in Neonates

**EEG HIE SOTON** is a program made during a Master degree Thesis named "An
automatic system for the classification of cerebral hypoxia in neonates at 2
years outcome through functional brain connectivity analysis of EEG data" at the
University of Southampton.

The program receives as input a set of raw EEG data from neonates and performs pre-processing,
features extraction and classification to obtain proper discrimination.

It makes use of the following libraries:

* [EEGLAB]
* [Brain Connectivity Toolbox]
* [FastICA]
* [HERMES Toolbox]
